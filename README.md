# Bouncing Egg Telegram Bot

## Introduction

This is a bot-backend for the messenger Telegram. It allows users to run simple commands by sending them in Telegram to a dedicated chat group or the bot itself, and receive messages generated by this program. A function already implemented is the /ts3 command, which queries a specified TeamSpeak3 server and responds with a list of members online.
