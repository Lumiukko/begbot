# Bouncing Egg Telegram Bot

## Introduction

This is a bot-backend for the messenger Telegram. It allows users to run simple commands by sending them in Telegram to a dedicated chat group or the bot itself, and receive messages generated by this program. A function already implemented is the `/ts3` command, which queries a specified TeamSpeak3 server and responds with a list of members online.

For an introduction for bot creation and usage see: https://core.telegram.org/bots

## Python Packages required:
* `python-telegram-bot` - https://github.com/leandrotoledo/python-telegram-bot/
